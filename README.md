# RarX_Marketplace Introduction
Rarx is a multi-chain and cross-chain advanced NFT marketplace with features like AI NFT Generation, Cross-chain NFTs, On-chain NFT Collections, Realtime Notifications, Subscriptions for artists, and many other features at one place


# RarX_Marketplace Technologies
We have integrated a lot of technologies to make our marketplace stand out and make it more useful. We started working on this project from a production perspective as we want to take our marketplace live and solve problems that existing NFT marketplaces have and simultaneously offer crazy and useful functionalities which will attract users to our marketplace.

1) Connext: we are using connext and NFTHashi for cross-chain NFTs. Connext makes the process of bridging NFTs very easy on our marketplace.
2) Polybase: This is the backbone of our marketplace, we are using polybase to store instances of users, NFTs, and collections when created on-chain. As it is a decentralized database with no downtime issues, we are fetching all the data from the polybase itself on our marketplace.
3) Push Protocol: we are using push protocol for real-time notifications, and chat between users is also handled by push chat. Push protocol respects the privacy of every chat as the messages are encrypted and stored on-chain.
4) Intmax: To provide a smooth user experience for the users who are using our marketplace on mobile phones and tablets we are using the Intmax wallet. Intmax wallet provides a lot of cool features like biometric verifications which eventually improve the UX of our marketplace.
5) Superfluid: We are using superfluid to back our membership subscriptions of artists.


# RarX_Marketplace Chains
Also as our marketplace is a multi-chain marketplace, we have deployed it on 6 different chains :

1) Gnosis chain: Gnosis Chain is a highly decentralized EVM blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions, scalability, community, and sustainable growth.
2) Polygon chain: Polygon zkEVM is the first zero-knowledge scaling solution that is fully equivalent to an EVM.
3) Scroll chain: Scroll is a zero-knowledge roll-up built to scale Ethereum.
4) Filecoin chain: FVM brings user programmability to Filecoin, unleashing the enormous potential of an open data economy.
5) Taiko chain: Taiko enables developers and users to experience Ethereum securely, with lower transaction fees, and without needing to consider any changes.
6) Mantle chain: Mantle is a high-performance Ethereum layer-2 network built with modular architecture delivering low fees and high security.
